This is a proof of concept phone application to help with recording kiwi signals/beeps. It is built in .net maui. Look at me mum, I'm an app developer.

Goals are:
* be able to store the beeps for a bird locally on the device
* to be able to access and transcribe those beeps at a later date
* be able to easily use it one handed (i.e. UI is skewed to one side of the phone) to allow for other hand to hold the aerial and receiver
* a UI to assist with easy recording i.e no unnecessary keys like when using on screen keyboard
